update-rc.d svc defaults
    Enable service at boot time. chkconfig svc on
update-rc.d -f svc remove
    Disable service at boot time. chkconfig svc off
    -f means force removal of the /etc/rc.? scripts while leaving the basic script in /etc/init.d (so you can change your mind later). --purge means remove the script from init.d.
update-rc.d svc start 20 2 3 4 5 . stop 20 0 1 6
    Enable service at boot time in the given runlevels, like chkconfig svc --levels 2345 on
For listing active services, I wrote a shell script: lsconfig
    What services are currently enabled? chkconfig --list
