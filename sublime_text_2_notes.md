## User File Settings

    {
        "font_face": "Monaco",
        "font_size": 12,
        "tab_size": 4,
        "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
        "use_tab_stops": true
    }

## Setup Sublime Command Line Helper

    ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" ~/usr/local/bin/subl

Now you can load a folder into Sublime from the command line.

    cd ~/Sites/mysite
    subl .

## Things Text Mate had that I Miss

- Git commit messages had syntax highlighting

## Wish List

- I wish I could hit CMD+p and type a path to a folder and then hit enter to have it loaded to my project.
- It would be nice if you could right click on a folder and have a choice to "open in terminal"
